# Self-Driving Car Control with RL in Webots
This project uses reinforcement learning to control a self-driving car in a Webots simulation, ensuring it stays within lanes and avoids obstacles. It demonstrates the application of RL in autonomous vehicles, with the model adapting to real-time dynamic environments
